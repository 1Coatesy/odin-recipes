            <li>1 large onion</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cook sausages: Heat oil in a large skillet / fry pan over medium high heat. 
                Add sausages and cook, turning, until browned as much as possible all over and cooked through. 
                Cook time will differ depending on sausage size.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove sausages onto a plate. Turn heat down to medium.
            </li>
            <li>
                2 tbsp oil remaining: You need around 2 tbsp oil left in the skillet. If you have much less, add a bit of butter or oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Saute onion and garlic: Add onion and garlic, cook until golden brown â€“ around 4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook off flour 2 minutes: Add flour and mix through. Then cook, stirring constantly for 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gradually add beef stock: Add about 3/4 cup of beef broth and mix into the onion so it becomes a sludge. 
                Then add remaining beef broth and mix until combined. If it's lumpy, use a whisk to help make it smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Thicken gravy: Simmer, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes until the gravy thickens but is slightly thinner than you want, it will thicken more as you serve it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season: Add salt and pepper. Stir, taste, then add more salt if you want.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve sausages with plenty of gravy, with mashed potato and peas on the side.
