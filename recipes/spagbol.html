        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Spaghetti bolognese (sometimes called spaghetti alla bolognese) is a pasta dish that is popular outside Italy, 
            but not part of traditional Bolognese or even Italian cuisine in general. 
            The dish is generally perceived as inauthentic when encountered by Italians abroad.
            It consists of spaghetti served with a sauce made from tomatoes, ground beef, garlic, wine and herbs; 
            sometimes ground beef can be replaced by other minced meats. 
            In this sense the sauce is actually more similar to Neapolitan ragù from the south of Italy than the northern Bolognese version of ragù.

        <ul>
            <li>400g minced beef</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>400g tin of chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tbsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 red or yellow pepper</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>3 carrots</li>

            <li>400g dried spaghetti</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat a large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat. 
                Once hot, add the chopped onion or leek, celery, red pepper, carrot and garlic with a pinch of salt. 
                Cook for 10 min or until everything has softened.  Add the stock cube, 250ml boiled water, tomato paste, and dried oregano.  
                Blend using a stick blender. 
            </li>
            <li>In a frying pan, brown the beef mince in a tbsp olive oil for about 5 mins.</li>
            <li>Add the browned mince to the vegetable tomato sauce. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 15-20 min or until the sauce has thickened to a Bolognese-like consistency.</li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, add your pasta of choice to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat. 
                Cook the pasta for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite. Once done, drain the cooked pasta and return it to the pot.
            </li>
            <li>Taste the Bolognese sauce for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed. </li>
        </ol>
